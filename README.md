# Card Battle Royale  
### Project Description
- Simulate a card battle royale between N players.  
- User may choose to play vs. bots or watch bots play each other.  
- Bots can play top-deck, random, or highest value card.  
- Shuffle the deck and split it into N equal parts.  
- Each player will receive their split of the deck as their "battle deck".  
- Players will then draw up to 5 cards into their hand depending on the game mode.  
- Players will simultaneously choose which card to play from their hand depending on their AI setting.  
- The player that played the highest value card will then capture all played cards as score under the "captured deck".  
- This "captured deck" will become the player's "battle deck" in the event that their battle deck is empty.  
- In the event of a tie, the those players will repeat the draw and play phase until there is one clear winner.  
- If any player runs out of cards at any moment, then they are eliminated from the game.  
- The last remaining player (should have possession of all the cards, N * 12 cards) is the winner.
